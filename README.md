# Hi, I'm Sean. ðŸ‘‹

## About Sean
I'm a creative and I'm a developer.  I'm a marketer and I'm a programmer. I'm an business leader and I'm a code monkey. I'm a behavioral analyst and a data evangelist. And I am voted most likely to be accused of split-personality in my career.

Throughout a 20+ year career, I've been a teacher, a writer, an artist, a scientist, a project manager and a product owner. I have served as a VP in one of the largest banks in the US, have led double-digit-sized teams, directed digital marketing strategy and ecommerce for a global Top 10 firm, founded and co-founded companies (albeit small ones so far), and designed and programmed the front-end of award-winning elearning applications, and product websites. I've bought media campaigns for top NY ad agencies and placed commercials for products such as General Motors, Bacardi, X-Box and Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson. I've had my name in the Wall Street Journal, and have consulted organizations across a range of industries on digital strategy, SEO, UX, integrated marketing, and branding, and company growth. 

I have also been accused of tooting my own horn when I try to synopsize my background - sorry about that.  But if I can't do a little horn-tooting on my own profile, where can I?

## Ok, joking aside, pump the brakes and explain yourself, Sean. 
#### <b>Your background is crazy business- and marketing-oriented. You don't exactly fit the typical developer mold.  How in the world did an MBA marketing creative, a former English teacher for goodness sake, come to be a developer?</b>



After years of front-end development heavily in HTML and CSS, I expanded my dev skillset to encompass a fuller range of full-stack development including node, express, react, and broad strengthening of my javascript skillset (ES6).  



## Education

| University | Degree | Highlights |
|------------|--------|------------|
| ![Appalachian State University](ASU.png = 50x) |  
I hold an undergraduate from Applachian State University where I studied on a full academic scholarship and was active in a number of social and academic organizations.  I hold an MBA from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where I received the highest honors awarded to a graduate. These honors included the Bryan Academic Honor Medal (GPA in excess of 3.9), Bryan Leadership & Achievement Award, and the Wall Street Journal Award - given to the single graduate or undergraduate student who excelled above all other graduatig students.  I was listed in the Wall Street Journal in 2006 in the WSJ Best in Class edition, and was included among the highest achieving MBAs in the nation.  I also will complete the Full Stack Developer program from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I currently hold an A+ grade average.

## Current Projects

I am currently head-down on a number of  projects that span fullstack development, in particular leveraging Node, Express, and React and interacting through all CRUD operations across mySQL, MongoDB, IndexedDb, and PostGres. I also continue to support a number of clients with digital strategy, UX design, front-end development, back-end development, SEO, graphic design, product maagement, and integrated marketing across digital and traditional channels.  And I play an active UX design and front-end development role on the active development of the Maui Insights platform (set to launch in Q1 2021), in addition to a more official role as the COO of the startup guiding business, operational, marketing, and financial decisions for the company alongside the CEO, CTO, and CSO co-founders.

## Currently Learning

In addition to bolstering JS skills and a never-ending polishing of translating design into digital experiences, I am also delving into Laravel, Python, and a number of JS libraries and frameworks including Vue, D3, and Angular.  I'd love to spend some time with Java and Objective-C/Swift.
