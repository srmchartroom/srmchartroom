# Hi, I'm Sean. ðŸ‘‹

## About Sean
I'm a creative and I'm a developer.  I'm a marketer and I'm a programmer. I'm an business leader and I'm a code monkey. I'm a behavioral analyst and a data evangelist. And I am voted most likely to be accused of split-personality in my career.

Throughout a 20+ year career, I've been a teacher, a writer, an artist, a manager, a consultant, and a developer.  I have served as a VP in one of the largest banks in the US, have led double-digit-sized teams, directed digital marketing strategy and ecommerce for a multinational org, founded and co-founded companies, and designed curriculum used by thousands. I've had my name in the Wall Street Journal, and have consulted organizations across a range of industries on digital strategy, SEO, UX, integrated marketing, and branding, and company growth. 


--------------------------------------
 
## Ok, joking aside, pump the brakes and explain yourself, Sean. 
#### <b>Your background is crazy business- and marketing-oriented. You don't exactly fit the typical developer mold.  How in the world did an MBA marketing creative, a former English teacher for goodness sake, come to be a developer?</b>



After years of front-end development heavily in HTML and CSS, I expanded my dev skillset to encompass a fuller range of full-stack development including node, express, react, and broad strengthening of my javascript skillset (ES6).

## Current Projects

I am currently head-down on a number of  projects that span fullstack development, in particular leveraging Node, Express, and React and interacting through all CRUD operations across mySQL, MongoDB, IndexedDb, and PostGres. I also continue to support a number of clients with digital strategy, UX design, front-end development, back-end development, SEO, graphic design, product maagement, and integrated marketing across digital and traditional channels.  And I play an active UX design and front-end development role on the active development of the Maui Insights platform (set to launch in Q1 2021), in addition to a more official role as the COO of the startup guiding business, operational, marketing, and financial decisions for the company alongside the CEO, CTO, and CSO co-founders.

## Currently Learning

In addition to bolstering JS skills and a never-ending polishing of translating design into digital experiences, I am also delving into Laravel, Python, and a number of JS libraries and frameworks including Vue, D3, and Angular.  I'd love to spend some time with Java and Objective-C/Swift.
